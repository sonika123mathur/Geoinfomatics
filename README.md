# About the Project
This report aims to analyze the drought at eight regions of interest in Xanten by comparing NDVI values with cumulative precipitation and average temperature.
In order to perform the analysis, precipitation data from a station located in Xanten and temperature data from two stations in Kleve and Wuppertal for a period between 2016 â€“ 2018 were retrieved and compared with the average  NDVI values of each region of interest in May/June 2016-2018. 
The analysis indicated a change in vegetation cover in three years periods with the lowest average cumulative precipitation recorded in the year 2018 and the highest temperature detected in July 2018.
The monthly analysis of cumulative precipitation indicates that the precipitation had an increasing trend from June to later months, and the temperature trend shows a high temperature between May to August with decreasing trends in other months in each year.
In general, the relationship between the cumulative precipitation and average temperature with NDVI were predominantly consistent with the various types of land uses across the region of interest with the reasonable correlation found in the pasture area.
The analysis indicated that the two out of eight regions were affected by drought that shows a correlation between NDVI, average temperature, and cumulative precipitation.
